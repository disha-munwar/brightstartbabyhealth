    <h2>Raising Healthy & Happy Kids (Ages 3‚Äì6)</h2>

    <div class="chapter">
      <h3>Chapter 1: Foundations of Healthy Parenting</h3>
      <p>Good parenting is built on love, security, and connection. Children thrive when they have consistent routines, clear expectations, and emotional support. Be present, listen actively, and model the behavior you want to see.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="chapter">
      <h3>Chapter 2: Smart Nutrition Choices</h3>
      <p>A balanced diet supports brain development, strong immunity, and healthy energy levels. Aim to provide:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Yogurt:</strong> A great source of probiotics and calcium.</li>
        <li><strong>Leafy Greens:</strong> Spinach and kale are packed with vitamins and iron.</li>
        <li><strong>Eggs:</strong> Loaded with protein and choline for brain growth.</li>
        <li><strong>Berries:</strong> Full of antioxidants and fiber.</li>
        <li><strong>Nuts & Seeds:</strong> Offer healthy fats and zinc.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Encourage colorful plates and limit added sugars. Let kids help with grocery lists and simple food prep ‚Äî it builds healthy habits early.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="chapter">
      <h3>Chapter 3: Emotional Development</h3>
      <p>Children experience big emotions they don‚Äôt always understand. Use feeling words daily (‚ÄúAre you frustrated?‚Äù) and show empathy. Help them learn calm-down strategies like deep breaths, drawing, or a quiet space.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="chapter">
      <h3>Chapter 4: Creating Consistent Routines</h3>
      <p>Schedules give kids a sense of security. Have regular times for meals, naps, screen use, and bedtime. Use visual charts with images to make it fun and predictable for little ones.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="chapter">
      <h3>Chapter 5: Play is Learning</h3>
      <p>Unstructured play boosts imagination, confidence, and problem-solving. Balance it with social play (with peers) and guided learning through books, puzzles, or educational games.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="chapter">
      <h3>Chapter 6: Growth Monitoring</h3>
      <p>Track your child‚Äôs growth regularly. If weight or height seems off track for age, consult a pediatrician. A downloadable growth chart can be a helpful reference ‚Äî check your tracker tools or visit local health apps.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="chapter">
      <h3>Chapter 7: Limiting Screen Time</h3>
      <p>Limit screens to 1 hour/day. Prioritize content that‚Äôs educational or co-viewed with a parent. Avoid screens during meals and 1 hour before bedtime.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="chapter">
      <h3>Chapter 8: When to Seek Help</h3>
      <p>If your child is not using full sentences by age 4, avoids eye contact, or shows extreme aggression or withdrawal ‚Äî seek professional advice. Early support makes a big difference.</p>
